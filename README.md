# Features

**Bitcoin Indexer** is a tool that continuously reads Bitcoin blocks from a connected Bitcoin
node in order to extract and index meta-protocol data contained within it. Once indexed, data is
stored in a Postgres DB and can be made available to clients or users via REST APIs.

# Quick Start

## Installing

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/hirosystems/bitcoin-indexer.git
$ cd bitcoin-indexer
$ cargo bitcoin-indexer-install
```

Docker images are also available at https://hub.docker.com/r/hirosystems/bitcoin-indexer

Note: You may need to install additional LLVM and Clang dependencies if they are not already available on your system.

## Running the Indexer

The following command will start indexing Ordinals activity and will continue to stream new blocks
once it reaches the Bitcoin chain tip.
```console
$ bitcoin-indexer ordinals service start --config-path <path>
```

A similar command exists for indexing Runes
```console
$ bitcoin-indexer runes service start --config-path <path>
```

A fully synced Bitcoin node is required for indexing to start.

## Running an API

Once the index starts advancing, you can deploy the Ordinals API or Runes API to read the same data
via REST endpoints.

# Configuration

Indexer configurations are set via a TOML file. To generate a new config file, run this command:
```console
$ bitcoin-indexer config new
```

Postgres database configurations are set like this. Each index will have its own database.
```toml
[ordinals.db]
database = "ordinals"
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
username = "postgres"
password = "postgres"
```

Ordinals meta-protocols like BRC-20 are also configured in this file
```toml
[ordinals.meta_protocols.brc20]
enabled = true
lru_cache_size = 10000

[ordinals.meta_protocols.brc20.db]
database = "brc20"
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
username = "postgres"
password = "postgres"
```

# System Requirements

The Bitcoin Indexer is resource-intensive, demanding significant CPU, memory and disk capabilities.
As we continue to refine and optimize, keep in mind the following system requirements and
recommendations to ensure optimal performance:

* CPU: The ordhook tool efficiently utilizes multiple cores when detected at runtime, parallelizing
tasks to boost performance.

* Memory: A minimum of 16GB RAM is recommended.

* Disk: To enhance I/O performance, SSD or NVMe storage is suggested.

* OS Requirements: Ensure your system allows for a minimum of 4096 open file descriptors.
Configuration may vary based on your operating system. On certain systems, this can be adjusted
using the `ulimit` command or the `launchctl limit` command.

## Postgres

To store indexed data, a Postgres database is required per index (ordinals, runes, etc.).
It is recommended to use Postgres 17+ for optimal performance.

## Bitcoin Node

To index data, a Bitcoin Node is required.
The indexer officially supports Bitcoin Core versions 0.24.x and 0.25.x.
